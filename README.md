### About Pinned Repos
Checkout some of the pinned projects below:
* [TransitMatters New Train Tracker](https://github.com/transitmatters/new-train-tracker) - Worked on improving the MBTA new train tracker dashboard
* Voice App 311 - An Amazon Alexa voice skill that allow users to ask for city services and other city conveniences such as farmers markets and food trucks
* Boston Info Slack Bot - Based on the previous work, I wrote a Slack bot to query food trucks for when the hunger kicks in without leaving your Slack workspace. This was part of a hackathon and I didn't end up publishing it; however, I will revisit in the near future
* My Wife's Todo - The motivation for this project is in its name. My wife has this very long "calendar" (really a long Google Doc) where she keeps track of her daily tasks. I'm trying to make her life easier
* Streaming Dataset - A collection of player and CDN metrics from large scale live events. This dataset was used in one of my latest pblications
